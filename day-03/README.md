# Barely Afloat
For this problem, you have to implement a program to print the numbers greater than the average of the numbers of a given array.
- **Preferred Languages: C, C++**

### Topics to learn
- Array traversal.
- Relational operators.

## Sample Input
```
12
97 8 16 79 99 53 20 42 95 52 63 14
```

## Sample Output
```
97 79 99 95 63
```

### Explanation
Average of the array elements `(97 + 8 + ... + 14) / 12 = 53.17`.
Elements of the array which are greater than `53.17` are printed on the screen.

### Input Format
One integer `n` presenting the number of elements.
`n` integers separated by one whitespace, on a newline.

### Output Format
Integers separated by one whitespace.
